# 9. Atmel Software Framework

The Atmel Software Framework (or ACF) is a framwork for developing embedded software for Atmel microcontrollers.
Both Atmel AVR and ARM-based controllers are supported.

## 9.1. Introduction

## 9.2. Downloading the ASF

Since the acquisition of Atmel by Microchip, a reorganization of the website has been ongoing.

The download link on Atmel's site now leads to this:

http://www.microchip.com/avr-support/advanced-software-framework-(asf)

The download link to the standalone edition is now (inexplicably) listed under the heading 'Windows (x86/x64)',
but it's just the same old archive as when it used to be on Atmel's old website. Just download it using that link.

(The advantage of Microchip's download link is that it works without registration.)
