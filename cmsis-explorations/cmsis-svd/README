Atmel distributes "atpack" files for each of its microcontrollers.

These contain, among other things, the SVD files that describe the memory-mapped peripherals of the microcontroller.

For the SAME70 microcontrollers, the ATPACK file can be obtained by executing:

    wget http://packs.download.atmel.com/Atmel.SAME70_DFP.2.0.78.atpack
